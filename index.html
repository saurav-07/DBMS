              <h2>IPL DataBase</h2>
                <p>We are creating a database of players playing in IPL for adding, removing, modifying the data of a player of a particular team.</p>
                <p>Three tables will be made storing the data of the players, the country table and the IPL team table.</p>
                <p>Only admin will access all the three tables and will have the eligibility to modify all three of them.</p>
                <p>And, the team owners will be secondary admin and will have the access of profile of players of their team only and will have the modification eligibility.</p>
                <p>And, players will have the access of their profile only and will be able to modify their profile.</p>
                <p>Then, the website will have global users with just viewing eligibility of any team or player.</p>
                <p>The data of the players and teams can be searched using the search bar.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>This is a web application project which has been designed and created using simple HTML and CSS. </p>
            <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>The motivation behind doing this project is the oppurtunity to learn about web development that has a deep sea under the surface of HTML and CSS only. We also came across many other languages like JavaSript and PHP that are used for front end and back end developments of the internet applications.</p>
            <h1>Learning</h1>
                <p>We started from scratch from YouTube like learning to basic design a web page and how to implement the design using HTML and CSS. We also came across some nice websites like w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com to learn new and advanced skills.</p>
